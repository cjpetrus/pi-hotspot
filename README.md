Pi Hotspot
==========
Turn your Raspberry Pi into a wireless hotspot if it cannot find and join a configured wifi network.

On the Raspberry Pi:

    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jesserockz/pi-hotspot/master/install.sh | sudo sh
    
The network name will be Zero-serial, where serial is the last 4 characters of your Raspberry Pi's serial number. The password to access the wifi will be zer0config.
